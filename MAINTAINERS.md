# Maintainers

This document details the basic processes relevant to project maintainers and everyone willing to contribute to the project (in any way).
Project maintainers and contributors should feel empowered to contribute back to this (or any other) document with any process changes they feel will improve the overall experience for themselves and others.

## Labels

Maintainers are encouraged to use the extensive and detailed list of labels for easier project management and issue tracking.
Generally, all issues should be labelled with (at least) one of the provided project labels.

* The most general labels are prefixed with either:
    * `change: `,
    * `bug: `,
    * `status: `,
    * `semver: `.
    
## Labels glossary

* `change: ` family of  labels should be added to all open issues indicating the related file changes in a certain aspect of the project:
    * `docs`,
    * `performance`,
    * `tests`,
    * `types`,
    * `code`.
* `bug: ` family of labels should be added to all open issues indicating the priority and complexity of the change:
