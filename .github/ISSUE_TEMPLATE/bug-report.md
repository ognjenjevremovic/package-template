<!---
Thank you for taking the interested in the project and for using Issue Tracker - it really helps me (and other contributors) prioritize and manage open issues more easily!
Before opening a new issue, please read the following:

 * Search for open/closed issues prior to opening a new one, as there might be an issue already opened (or closed, with a PR accepted/rejected) for the issue you're facing,
 * Please try to be as descriptive as possible and try to fill as much as information about the issue you're facing,
 * Be patient - it might take some time, before replying to your issue (or even having the fix ready).
